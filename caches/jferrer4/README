What Works: Everything but the Hot-Cold approximation works.
However, the output for it is not too far off from the actual accuracy
provided in the sample output files.

Extra-Credit: I have done the extra credit.
Testing: take out the "//" from the print statement in line 142 then compile and
run the program. This will print out the results of my function to the command
line.

What have I done: One thing I learned in CS350 is that sometimes the way to make
an algorithm better than other two algorithms is by combining the best
characteristics of both. So what I did was combine both the LRU replacement and
the Next-Line prefetcher to take advantage of the best characteristics of each.

Why it works:
The reason why this works is because LRU replacement already has one of the best
hit rates since it has to look through the whole cache, however, by prefetching
the next line now we have an even greater accuracy since the following line is
very likely to be accessed next.
